## Hello everyone !
### I'm a fullstack developer

My name is Quentin Heinis and i'm based in France. I am a passionate developer, I like to develop websites and web interfaces as well as video games and applications. I specialize in web development.

I did a university bachelor's degree in technology called multimedia and internet professions where I was able to learn the basics of web development. However I have acquired most of my knowledge through projects that I have built or participated in. And I am self-taught for the development of video games and applications.

I am constantly in the desire to learn or create new things. I'm here to find solutions to problems.

I am currently on a work-study program.
I work for a small company based in Belfort as a web developer.
